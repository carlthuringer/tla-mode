# TLA Mode
An Emacs major mode for editing TLA+ specifications.

**WARNING** Currently very hacky and dependent on multiple forks. PRs will be tracked here, and as they are integrated this will get easier to use.

## Installation

With `straight.el` and use-package integration
```elisp
(use-package tla-mode
  :straight (:repo "carlthuringer/tla-mode"))
```
